Scala is compile and interpreted language where as java is only complile language.
Java code is compliled first and then run. In case of complile, error is thrown at any point in java code 
where as in case of interpreter, its is step by step process. if there is any error in step6, it will result in error only at that point.

phython,javascript etc are interpreted languages.
Java is compile language

In interpretted language, compiling building and deploying code is very very less.

REPL --> Read Evaluate Print loop

Scala has interpretation and compliling mode. while doing prototyping, use interpreter mode and while deploying into production you can use
complier mode.
scala also has scalac and scala similar to javac and java

advantage of scala is you can caught that error during complile time but not in phython etc.

Spark is build on top of map reduce model which supports iterative algorithms, stream processing etc

It is backward compatabile that is hive queries that are written can be run on spark.

Bacth computing:

Stream computing:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Functional Programming:

You can treat function as variable.
pass funttion as argument to a function ---> This is called as Higher order function.
Retun function as an argument.
Have array of functions.

All these are not possible in java.

Scala is language which runs on top of java.
Java take care of memmory management that is one advanatage in java. Java is complile language that is error is caught at comile time before executing it.

Scala is OO, Funcational Programing..
Features--> Automatically Type Inference, 


Type of Null: In java you keep on checking if variable is null or not, 
Scala doesnt have null and avoids NullPointerException.


Pattern Matching, collection.
